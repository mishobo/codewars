# What is asynchronous programming?
- Asynchronous programming was devised to accommodate for the lag between when a function is called to when the value of that function is returned.
- Asynchronous programming in Java allows you to execute the tasks concurrently improving the overall performance and responsiveness of your applications.

# Multithreading in Java
Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU. 
Each part of such program is called a thread. So, threads are light-weight processes within a process.

Threads can be created by using two mechanisms :
1. Extending the Thread class
2. Implementing the Runnable Interface
